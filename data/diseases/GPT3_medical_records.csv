OMIM:159700,Myoclonus And Ataxia,"Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Myoclonus And Ataxia present clinical features that include cognitive impairment, ataxia, myoclonus, and epileptic seizures. This study aims to investigate the genetic and clinical characteristics of Myoclonus And Ataxia patients in a Brazilian cohort.

METHODS:

We performed a retrospective study of patients with Myoclonus And Atax. Some special cases also present other clinical features such as epilepsy, cognitive impairment, or ataxia.

RESULTS:

We identified 18 patients with Myoclonus And Ataxia, and their clinical features were analyzed. The mean age at onset was 9.5 years (range, 3-16 years). The mean age at diagnosis was 17.2 years (range, 9-25 years). The mean age at last follow-up was 23.5 years (range, 18-32 years). The mean age at death was 26.3 years (range, 19-32 years). The mean age at onset of epilepsy was 15.2. The main symptomatic differences of Myoclonus And Ataxia from similar diseases is that it presents a late onset of epilepsy, cognitive impairment, and ataxia.

CONCLUSIONS:

The clinical features of Myoclonus And Ataxia are similar to other diseases, but the late onset of epilepsy, cognitive impairment, and ataxia are distinctive.

The syndrome is named after Dr. Liang-wang Zhang, a Chinese pediatrician who first described the syndrome in a paper published in Chinese in 1980.

Liang-wang Syndrome is. Some special cases also present with:

The syndrome is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase. This enzyme is involved in the synthesis of mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol.

The syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective. The main symptomatic differences of Liang-wang Syndrome from similar diseases is that the former is caused by a mutation in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase gene, while the latter are caused by mutations in the mevalonate kinase gene.
